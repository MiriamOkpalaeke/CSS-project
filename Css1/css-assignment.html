          I love technology because it helps me keep  touch with friends and family, 
             even if they live on a different side of the globe. This is made possible with the use of telephones, emails, socia media and lots more.
				It also helps my work easier and faster. Instead of doing things manually for example, when cooking the use of blenders, air-fryers and electric cookers has made cooking
				faster and easier.

<p><b><i>So far I learnt the basis of CSS. CSS is an acronym for Cascading style sheets. It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design.
	 Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds. 
   CSS is important because it allows several innovations to webpage layout. Innovations such as; Specify fonts other than the default for the browser,
	specify color and size of text and links, apply colors to backgrounds,
	Contain webpage elements in boxes and float those boxes to specific positions on the page and lots more.</i></b></p>

  <p><b><i>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content.
     Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
    A border is a line that seperates the the inner content from the outer content. In a box model the border is in between the padding and marging.</b></i></p>
